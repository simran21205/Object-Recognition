# Object-Recognition

Abstract - This study assesses the performance of two prominent object recognition models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, us- ing the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), which features com- plex and dynamic driving environments typical of Indian road conditions. The objective is to compare these mod- els in terms of their accuracy, speed, and reliability in de- tecting various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs amidst the challenging scenes presented in the IDD. Following the performance benchmarking, we employ the Tool for Identifying Errors in Detections (TIDE) to con- duct a detailed error analysis. The findings aim to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, of- fering guidance on their applicability in realworld, diverse driving contexts like those found in India.

Conclusion - The analysis of YOLOv5 on the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD) and Faster R-CNN on the KITTI dataset underscores the strength and limitations of object detection models in varying contexts. While YOLOv5 shows strong perfor- mance for larger vehicles on IDD but struggles with smaller objects, Faster R-CNN excels with traffic-related objects on KITTI, though it could improve in detecting vans and trucks. This comparison highlights the necessity for ongo- ing model enhancements and training data diversification to boost accuracy and adaptability in diverse tracking environments.
